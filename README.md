# PauseBackendPlugin
A plugin that adds a button to pause/resume autoslicing to the sidebar in Cura.
This is functionally the same as toggling the "Slice automatically when changing settings" checkbox on the
General pane of the preferences.

The development of this plugin can be sponsored via Github Sponsors (https://github.com/sponsors/fieldofview) or Paypal (https://www.paypal.me/fieldofview)
